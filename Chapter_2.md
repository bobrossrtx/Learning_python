### Constants
> Fixed values such as numbers, letters, strings

### Reserved words
> False,	def	if	raise
> None,	del	import	return
> True,	elif,	in,	try
> and,	else,	is,	while
> as,	except,	lambda,	with
> assert,	finally,	nonlocal,	yield
> break,	for,	not	
> class,	from,	or	
> continue,	global,	pass

### Variables
> Variables is a assignment for a value
> You get to choose the name of a variable
> Can only start with _ or lower case
> No dashes aloud, -

### Mnemonic Variable Names
> Since the variable names are declared by the programmer, python doesn't read the variable name to mean something, it only reads the definition with in the variable.
> Names that are descriptive can be read easier by the user, but python will be happy with a completely gibberish name like: uj9234_dafs2o

### Assignment Statements
> A variable is an assignment statement
> Requires the right side of the value to be valid for the left side to be valid

### Numeric Expressions
> + Addition
> - Subtraction
> * Multiplication
> / Division
> ** Power
> % Remainder

### Order of Evaluation
> When we code in python, we need to know what comes first
> This is called "operator precedence"
#### Operator Precedence Rules:
> Parentheses are always respected
> Exponentiation (raise to a power)
> Multiplication, Division, Remainder
> Addition and Subtraction
> left to right
